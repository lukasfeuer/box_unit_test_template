# Template | Unit Testing of Modular R Code

This project provides a template for unit testing of modular R code with the  [\{testthat\}](https://testthat.r-lib.org) package and the \{box\} package.



TODO
* add references to recouses (testthat/box documentation)
* add integration with \{renv\} package
* add instructions for user to set up (testthat/box/renv)?
* add reference / highlight differences when using a specialized .Rprofile 


Instructions: 
* Recommended to also use the \{renv\} package for package version control. Run renv::init() after modules are set up and code is running as intended. Initializing to early will potentially require many manual installations to local package library
